# TypedPhoneGap

Strives to provide up-to-date [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org)
definitions for the [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) (Cordova 2.5.0)
API, and implements a TypedPhoneGap library to provide extra type
safety to parts of the Cordova API that are not sufficiently typed.

## Motivation

PhoneGap is a promising project that can alleviate some of the pain
for cross-platform mobile native application development.  It is,
however, plagued by imprecise and incomplete documentation.  By
providing TypeScript bindings to PhoneGap/Cordova API we can
significantly reduce the cost of writing and maintaining correct
programs on this platform.

## Status

Currently the bindings are being written from the latest
documentation, and are incomplete - if you are looking for more
complete TypeScript PhoneGap bindings please consider using the
bindings by
[DefinitelyTyped](http://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped)

When the bindings are complete we will consider merging with into the
DefinitelyTyped repository.
