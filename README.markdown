## Motivation

TypeScript definitions allow editing code with some degree of type
checking and code completion.  It saves time and eliminates bugs.

It turns out that simple `.d.ts` is not enough, since Cordova API is
weird.  So TypedPhoneGap provides a little JavaScript layer as
well. To see why it is worth it, consider for example how Cordova has
you write (with `inappbrowser` plugin):

```javascript
window.open('http://apache.org', '_blank', 'location=yes');    
```    

Here, what should go into options string? You do not know without
reading the docs.

TypedPhoneGap, on the other hand, makes everything pleasantly typed:

```typescript
import IAB = TypedPhoneGap.InAppBrowser;
var iab = IAB.getPlugin();
iab.openWindow('http://apache.org', IAB.Target.blank, {
  location: true
});
```

You can examine `Options` interface to see what is available.  Also,
where possible, `getPlugin` functions do checks and fire informative
exceptions when you forget to configure your application with a given
plugin.

## Status

Rewritten for version 3.4.0 and TypeScript 0.9.7.  Currently testing,
API subject to change.

## Building

Build the project with [npm][npm].  In the root folder, do:

```
npm install
```

This should obtain three files:

```
build/TypedPhoneGap.d.ts
build/TypedPhoneGap.js
build/TypedPhoneGap.min.js
```

## Usage

In your application, reference the `.d.ts` for TypeScript development
and include the `.js` or `.min.js` after `cordova.js`.

The project includes a command-line tool to help populate files in a
project generated by the `cordova` tool.  Synopsis:

```
cd myapp
npm install -g typedphonegap
typedphonegap install
```

This populates your project with:

```
www/js/TypedPhoneGap.js
www/js/TypedPhoneGap.min.js
www/typings/TypedPhoneGap.d.ts
```
